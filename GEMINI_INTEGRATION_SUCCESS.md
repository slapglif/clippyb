# Gemini Integration Success for ClippyB

## Summary
Successfully integrated Google Gemini AI (model: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) into ClippyB to replace the failing Ollama implementation.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Direct Gemini API Implementation
- Created `src-tauri/src/agents/gemini_direct.rs` with `GeminiDirectCoordinator`
- Implements direct API calls to Google Gemini without using rig's problematic extractor
- Uses the exact model name `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` as requested
- Includes proper `generationConfig` in API requests

### 2. Updated Main Application
- Modified `src-tauri/src/main.rs` to use `GeminiDirectCoordinator` 
- Set Gemini as default LLM provider with the provided API key
- Updated both `is_music_related()` and `react_search_for_song()` to support Gemini

### 3. Key Features
- Structured JSON output for search query generation
- Result analysis with confidence scoring
- Multi-iteration search refinement
- Clean JSON response parsing with error handling

## Testing Results
- ✅ Compilation successful
- ✅ Gemini API connection working
- ✅ Music content detection functioning (correctly rejected non-music text)
- ✅ Uses exact model name `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`

## API Configuration
```rust
// Default provider set to Gemini with user's API key
LLMProvider::Gemini {
    api_key: "AIzaSyDepY_ZOJPQCmz62H8K23LB_TH2CVGyoT4".to_string(),
}
```

## Next Steps
To fully test the integration:
1. Copy a Spotify URL (e.g., `https://open.spotify.com/track/...`)
2. ClippyB will automatically detect it and process it
3. The song should be downloaded to your Music folder

## Technical Details
The implementation bypasses rig's Gemini provider (which had issues with `generationConfig`) and uses direct HTTP API calls with proper request formatting.
